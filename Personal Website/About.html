        Currently, I am in my second semester of my junior year here at Texas
        A&M. I have finished most all of my basics with the exception of
        business courses and am solely focused on computer science. On any given
        day, I spend anywhere between 2-5 hours coding, with the times
        fluctuating more on the weekend depending on my workload. Much of this
        time is spent on school specific projects as I am in three coding-heavy
        courses:
        <i>Intro to Computer Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms,</i> and
        <i>Programming Studio</i>. Although this schedule leaves me with little
        freetime I rarely feel bogged down as I enjoy the work. If anything,
        this semester has and continues to show me how much I have left to
        learn, and how I am capable of more than I previously thought. My other
        two classes are a seminar class that meets up once a week and listens to
        guest speakers in industry give their experience, and an online
        management class for my business emphasis area.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
        Other than classes I am involved in two clubs:
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TAMUCyberSec/">CyberSecurity</a> and
        <a href="https://tacs.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M Computing Society</a>. Both
        clubs are similar to my seminar class as they welcome speakers to give
        speeches in a more casual setting. Unfortunately, my involvment in both
        clubs has seen a decrease this and last semester as my courseload has
        become more time-consuming.

        I was born in Houston, Texas but moved to and currently live in Katy,
        Texas, a rapidly growing town west of Houston. I went to Seven Lakes
        High School where I joined the marching band playing percussion. Band
        was a passion of mine that led me to make life-long friends and
        eventually meet my girlfriend at the end of my senior year. After
        graduating I kept in contact with my old instructor and helped teach at
        George Ranch High School, George Bush High School, and North Shore High
        School. For the past 7-8 months I've held a job at Under Armour back in
        my hometown, taking extended breaks during the school year. In my
        freetime I enjoy working out, cooking, and outdoor activities. Ever
        since entering college I decided to take my health more serious,
        especially because of the sedentary lifestyle of coding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
        My time here at A&M has brought along with it some great memories.
        Although I am not as involved as other students in organizations I still
        have made many friends in my classes and around campus that have made
        the decision to come here worth it. I hope to carry the traditions and
        values of a true Aggie everywhere I go in the future.
