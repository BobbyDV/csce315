      <!-- GOALS -->
      <h1 style="font-size: 45px; color: rgb(54, 129, 122);">
        <strong><u>Goals in Computer Science</u></strong>
      </h1>
      <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
        I was first introduced to computer science my senior year of high school
        and immediately felt a connection. The past three years have only
        solidified that connection with various school projects and outside
        learning. Although I have made progress in the last three years, I want
        to venture out of my comfort zone in relation to the projects and
        languages/programs I learn in and out of the classroom. Texas A&M is an
        amazing school for computer science, but my classes can only do so much
        on their own. My immediate goal is to get a co-op or internship to break
        through to the next level in the industry; to get an idea of the kind of
        work I may be doing for the next few years, or of an area that I may
        ultimately not have much interest in so I can focus on others. The kind
        of work I find fulfilling is the kind that makes a difference in
        people's lives. It may not be the biggest difference, but the greatest
        gift of technology is the ease of life it provides. To be a part of that
        process in a meaningful way makes what I do everyday worth the time and
        work put in. While this is happening, I will continue to improve as a
        programmer, especially outside of my classes. My next steps are to
        solidify my expertise of the more advanced and data structures; being
        able to demonstrate my knowledge in personal projects. As I already know
        C++, Java, and Python, I feel moving on to scripting languages and
        cloud-based services will round out my skills. This upcoming summer,
        beginning in May, I hope to finish all the goals I have set for myself
        and more. Thank you for reading and stay tuned for any updates in the
        future.
