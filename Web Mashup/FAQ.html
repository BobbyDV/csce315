      <ul>
        <li>Will there be more features added in the future?</li>
        <p>
          While there are more features we have thought about adding (hotels,
          travel tickets, etc.) we do not have plans to add those at this time.
          If we decide to regularly update TraView, there will be a notice here!
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>Why is the place I am searching for not coming up?</li>
        <p>
          TraView uses Google Maps and Google Places to search for locations
          based on your search query! If a location is not showing up it is most
          likely due to the fact that Google does not recognize your search.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <li>How does TraView work?</li>
        <p>
          TraView is a web mashup that uses multiple API's for a common purpose.
          API's that TraView currently includes are Yelp, OpenWeatherMap, Google
          Places, and Google Maps.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <li>Why make TraView?</li>
        <p>
          TraView was created for a school project at Texas A&M University.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <li>Will TraView ever be a full-fledged product?</li>
        <p>
          Maybe! Any of the four members working on this may decide to continue
          to flesh it out even after the project is finished. Admittedly, it is
          unlikely the product will continue, but there's always a possibility!
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <li>Why isn't data showing up for some locations I put in?</li>
        <p>
          Currently, TraView only fully works for city, state, or country
          searches. This is due to the fact that we are using the name of the
          location to get certain data (Yelp and Weather). These two API's take
          in city, state, or country names. If you enter in an exact location,
          the API's do not know where to search for. This will actually be a
          feature that is updated in time since the current way is inconvienent.
