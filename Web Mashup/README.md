WEB MASHUP: TRAVIEW (Group Project)
-----------------------------------------------------------
TraView is a web mashup that uses 5 API's: Google Maps, Google Places, Yelp-Fusion, OpenWeatherMap, and HTML Geolocation. It's goal is to
give users a list of tourist attractions, restaurants, and the weather given a city, state, or country so that they may better
plan out their vacations.

For this project, I implemented all 5 API's using JavaScript and formatted them using CSS. I also did a majority of the website aesthetics.
