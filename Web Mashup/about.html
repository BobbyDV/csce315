      <h2>About TraView</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Your team is to build a system that puts together different existing web
      components in an application that provides a quality user interface to the
      joined components. (Such applications are often called mashups.) The
      project is meant to be relatively open-ended and give your team the
      freedom to make many decisions regarding the form of the project itself.
      It is as if you have been given funding for an initial prototype of a new
      product. A key focus of this project will be the process, including
      collecting and using user feedback. Your product can include different
      languages behind the scenes, but the overall goal is a quality user
      interface that also includes an element of accessibility. The thought is
      that this will be a web page, accessible to anyone with a browser, but
      successful projects have built stand-alone apps (With prior approval.) -->
        TraView is an application that will give users relevant information on
        any place they are interested. Our goal is to streamline the vacation
        process by bringing the most important aspects to you in an easy,
        convenient, and user-friendly package. Whether planning a trip or taking
        a virtual tour of the world, see what TraView has to offer you today!

          Rory is a sophomore Computer Science Major at Texas A&M University. His roles
          on the team were making an attempt at coding and helping write the documentation for 
          various assignments. After undergrad, Rory plans to continue his education with a Master's
          in Computer Science.

          John Sikes is a senior Computer Engineering Major at Texas A&M University, with planned minors
          in CyberSecurity and Mathematics. Primarily responsible for gathering user feedback with regards
          to TraView, he succeeded in documenting and compiling feedback into a useable state where questions,
          comments, and concerns can be accounted for. Upon graduation, John hopes to find a career in security,
          hopefully not crashing any delicate systems in the process.
